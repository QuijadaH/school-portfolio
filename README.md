Piggy-Pon – Smart Savings Tracker for Kids, Teens, and Students Piggy-Pon is a web-based smart piggybank platform that helps users—especially students and young savers—develop better saving habits through a connected, goal-driven experience. Built to work seamlessly with a physical ESP-based coin-counting device, Piggy-Pon transforms coin drops into visual progress and real-time savings insights.

It addresses common issues in manual saving, such as tracking errors, forgotten goals, and lack of motivation. The app uses a violet-themed interface to symbolize ambition, creativity, and financial clarity.

Key Features
Goal-Based Saving – Set personal savings goals with progress bars, deadlines, and motivational prompts.

Real-Time Deposit Tracking – Syncs instantly with the Piggy-Pon device through Firebase, or allows manual deposits via the web app.

Interactive Reports – View charts and transaction logs to understand your saving behavior over time.

Responsive Web Design – Works across mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.

Profile & Settings Management – Connect to your hardware, export reports, and manage your savings preferences.
